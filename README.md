<h1 align="center">PROMPT-TO-CODE PROJECT<br/>IBM GRANITE AI</h1>

<h3 align="center">Create By: <br/>Rhisma Syahrul putra</h3>

**Background This Project**

<p align="justify">Prompt engineering is still a relatively new field and remains unfamiliar to many people in Indonesia. Most users are not yet aware of how to interact effectively with AI systems to achieve optimal results. This project was developed as a web-based learning platform to introduce the fundamentals of prompt engineering using the generative AI capabilities of IBM Granite. Through a simple and interactive interface, users can directly experience how a well-crafted prompt can influence the response generated by the AI.</p>

**Objective**

<p align="justify">This project aims to introduce the fundamentals of prompt engineering to the Indonesian public through an interactive web-based application. It allows users to write prompts and observe how AI responds, promoting exploration-based learning.</p>

**Problem Statement**

<p align="justify">Despite the growing popularity of generative AI, many people in Indonesia still lack a clear understanding of how to interact effectively with AI systems. This lack of prompt engineering knowledge limits their ability to fully harness AIâ€™s potential in learning, work, and innovation.</p>

**Tech Stack List**

- Node.Js
- Express.Js
- CORS
- dotenv
- axios
- nodemon
- IBM Granite AI API

<h2>HOW TO USE</h2>
### Cloning the Repository

To get a local copy of this project on your machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Open your terminal or command prompt.**

2.  **Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project.** For example:

    ```bash
    cd Documents/Projects
    ```

3.  **Clone the repository using the `git clone` command:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

    Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of the repository you want to clone. You can find this URL on the repository's page (usually a green "Code" button). It will look something like this:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/RhismaSyahrulPutra/backend-ai
    ```

4.  **The repository will be downloaded to your local machine.** A new directory with the same name as the repository will be created in the directory you specified.

5.  **Navigate into the newly created directory:**

    ```bash
    cd backend-ai
    ```

You now have a local copy of the project and can start working on it!

### Frontend Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get the frontend application up and running:

1.  **Install Dependencies:**

    Open your terminal, navigate to the `backend-ai` directory (or the root directory if the instructions are for the root), and run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment Variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project (if it doesn't already exist). Add the following variables to the `.env` file, replacing the placeholders with the appropriate values for your backend setup:

    ```
    PORT=<your_backend_port>
    REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=<your_replicate_api_token>

    ```

    - `PORT`: The port number your backend server will listen on (e.g., 5000).
    - `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN`: Your API token for accessing the Replicate service.

3.  **Run the Development Server:**

    Start the development server using the following command:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This will typically start the application in your browser at a URL like `http://localhost:5000` (the exact URL will be displayed in your terminal output).

4.  **Code Formatting and Linting:**

    To ensure consistent code style and catch potential errors, use the following commands to format and lint your code after making changes:

    ```bash
    npm run format
    npm run lint
    ```

    These commands will automatically format your code according to the project's style guidelines and identify any linting issues. Make sure to address any linting errors before committing your changes.
